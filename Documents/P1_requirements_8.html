    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The website's typical user will be students attending events during "UKA".
        The students will use the website to find a map of the venues where UKAs events are beeing held
        and where the foodtruck is placed. They will also find the menu, place orders and 
        find and overview of the opening hours. Since many of the events sell a lot of alcohol,
        the webpage should be simple to navigate for people who might be a bit intoxicated.

            This page will contain more information about the Foodtruck and the people running it. It will also contain
            some information about if and when the Foodtruck is recruiting for an upcoming UKA.
        </li>
        <li>"Contact Us" <br>
            This page will contain the contact information of the people in charge of the Foodtruck, aswell as a form to
            make contact directly from the website. It will also again show the location of the Foodtruck, since for
            people navigating the site looking for where the Foodtruck is the Contact Us page would be a natural place
            to look if you didn't see it on the home page.
