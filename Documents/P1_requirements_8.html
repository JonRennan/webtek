    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The website's typical user will be students attending events during "UKA".
        The students will use the website to find a map of the venues where UKAs events are beeing held
        and where the foodtruck is placed. They will also find the menu, place orders and 
        find and overview of the opening hours. Since many of the events sell a lot of alcohol,
        the webpage should be simple to navigate for people who might be a bit intoxicated.

    <h2>The content of the site and how it is organized</h2>
    <ol start="0">
        <li>
            "Navigation" <br>
            <p>
                A few things will be visible on every page of the website.
                Firstly, it will contain an easily visible and clear navbar that communicates what choices one can make, as well as give the user a mental model of where they are in the website's structure at all times. This navbar should have a link to the home-page, as well as a menu containing links to the food trucks menu, an “about-us”-page, a “contact”-page, and a “map and location”-page. On larger devices we plan on having this menu open and visible at all times, however, on smaller mobile devices we plan on making it into a dropdown menu.
                Every page should have a footer at the bottom of the page, containing necessary information.
                Finally, every page should have a consistent graphic profile and structure, making it easy to understand the structure of the website, and how it functions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"Home" <br>
            <p>
                The home-page is the first surface the user sees when entering the website. Therefore, it’s important that they don’t get startled with too much information, rather giving them an overview of where they can navigate to, and what information is available.
                Therefore,the home-page will contain an illustration with text, that ensures the user that they have come to the right place. Alongside this we plan on having a “sign” that displays if the food truck is open or not, and potentially when it will open next.
                Further down the user will find a map of the festival-area, indicating where the food-truck is located. The reason for having this on the home-page is that we suspect that location is information that many first-time-users wish to get right away. It will also be possible to find the map and location via the navbar, so that the user can find it from any page on the website.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"Menu" <br>
            <p>
                When arriving at the menu-page, the user will be presented with the different options of food and drinks they can order from the food truck. The items will be listed downward, with the belonging information on description, price and allergies. They will be listed hierarchically in groups such as: burgers, wraps, snacks, drinks etc. For each item it will be possible to add and subtract from your order.
                Above the menu we wish to include a filtering-system, where the user can filter out non-vegan alternatives for example.
                At the bottom, we want to include a comment-section where users can specify things about their order, such as subtracting ingredients they don’t like or tolerate.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"About Us" <br>
            This page will contain more information about the Foodtruck and the people running it. It will also contain
            some information about if and when the Foodtruck is recruiting for an upcoming UKA.
        </li>
        <li>"Contact Us" <br>
            This page will contain the contact information of the people in charge of the Foodtruck, aswell as a form to
            make contact directly from the website. It will also again show the location of the Foodtruck, since for
            people navigating the site looking for where the Foodtruck is the Contact Us page would be a natural place
            to look if you didn't see it on the home page.
