    <h2>Our client</h2>
    <p>
        During the month of October this year, Norway's biggest cultural festival will be coming to
        Trondheim. UKA is a bi-yearly festival entirely run on a volunteer basis by the city's
        students. During the festival there will be a food truck serving food at various events. The
        food truck is quite small in terms of manpower, so there isn't much room for a focus on promotion.
        This is, however, something that will help get the word out about the food truck and boost sales.

    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
    <p>
        To give the food truck better visibility and better availability, the boss of the food truck requested a simple,
        yet good-looking, website to be made. The website should be able to show where the food truck is, its opening
        hours, as well as showing the menu and enable the customers to order their food through it.
    </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The website's typical user will be students attending events during "UKA". The students will use the website to
        find a map of the venues where UKAs events are being held and where the food truck is placed. They will also
        find the menu, place orders and find and overview of the opening hours. Since many of the events sell a lot of
        alcohol, the webpage should be simple to navigate and use for people who might be a bit intoxicated.

    <h2>The content of the site and how it is organized</h2>
    <ol start="0">
        <li>
            "Navigation of the site"
            <p>
                To navigate the site there will be an easily visible and clear navbar that communicates what choices one
                can make, as well as showing the user where they are on the website. On larger devices we plan on having
                this menu open and visible at all times, however, on smaller mobile devices we plan on making it into a
                dropdown menu. Every page should have a footer at the bottom of the page, containing necessary
                information. Finally, every page should have a consistent graphic profile and structure, making it easy
                to understand the structure of the website, and how it functions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"Home"
            <p>
                The home page will give the user an overview of where they can navigate to, and what information is
                available. It will have a “sign” that displays if the food truck is open or not, and potentially when it
                will open next. Further down the user will find a map of the festival-area, indicating where the food
                truck is located.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"Menu"
            <p>
                The menu-page will present the user with the different options of food and drinks they can order from
                the food truck. The items will be listed downward, with a description, price and potential allergy
                triggers. They will be listed hierarchically in groups such as: burgers, wraps, snacks, drinks etc. For
                each item it will be possible to add and subtract from your order. Above the menu we wish to include a
                filtering-system, where the user can filter out non-vegan alternatives for example. At the bottom there
                will be a comment-section where users can specify things about their order, such as subtracting
                ingredients they don’t like or tolerate.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"About Us"
            <p>
                The about us page will meet the user with images and information about the food truck. Its purpose is to
                inform the user about what it's like to work and make them want to join the food truck for the next UKA.
                Since this is the purpose of the page it will also contain some information about if and when the
                food truck is recruiting for an upcoming UKA and what you would have to do to get recruited.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>"Contact Us"
            <p>
                This page will contain the contact information of the people in charge of the food truck, as well as a
                form to make contact directly from the website. It will also direct users to the About Us page if they
                have questions about recruitment. This page will also again show the location of the food truck.
            </p>
