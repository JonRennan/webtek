    <h2>Our client</h2>
    <p>
        During the month of October this year, Norway's biggest cultural festival will be coming to
        Trondheim. UKA is a bi-yearly festival entirely run on a volunteer basis by the city's
        students. During the festival there will be a food truck serving food at various events. The
        food truck is quite small in terms of manpower, so there isn't much room for a focus on promotion.
        This is, however, something that will help get the word out about the food truck and boost sales.

    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
    <p>
        To give the food truck better visibility and better availability, the boss of the food truck requested a simple,
        yet good-looking, website to be made. The website should be able to show where the food truck is, its opening
        hours, as well as showing the menu and enable the customers to order their food through it.

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The website's typical user will be students attending events during "UKA". The students will use the website to
        find a map of the venues where UKAs events are being held and where the food truck is placed. They will also
        find the menu, place orders and find and overview of the opening hours. Since many of the events sell a lot of
        alcohol, the webpage should be simple to navigate and use for people who might be a bit intoxicated.
