    <h2> Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>
        During the month of October this year, Norway's biggest cultural festival will be coming to
        Trondheim. UKA is a bi-yearly festival entirely run on a volunteer basis by the city's
        students. During the festival there will be a food truck serving food at various events. The
        food truck is quite small in terms of manpower, so there isn't much room for a focus on promotion.
        This is, however, something that will help get the word out about the food truck and boost sales.

    <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
    <p>
        To give the food truck better visibility and better availability, the boss of the food truck requested a simple,
        yet good-looking, website to be made. The website should be able to show where the food truck is, its opening
        hours, as well as showing the menu and enable the customers to order their food through it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website's typical user will be students attending events during "UKA". The students will use the website to
        find a map of the venues where UKAs events are being held and where the food truck is placed. They will also
        find the menu, place orders and find and overview of the opening hours. Since many of the events sell a lot of
        alcohol, the webpage should be simple to navigate and use for people who might be a bit intoxicated.

    <h2>Navigation Structure </h2>
    <p>
        The navigation structure of the website for UKAs food truck can be described as clique, see figure below.
        As shown in the figure, you can reach every page except the order page no matter where you are on the website.
        The pages are accessible through a navbar on the top of the website. The order site is only reachable from the
        menu site as it is a site to confirm your order.

    <h2>Content</h2>

    <div>
        <h3>Menu</h3>
        <p>
            This page will contain a list of all the items on the menu, what they are, what they look like, what they
            contain and what they cost. The page will also contain buttons for each item to add or remove them from your
            order. This page fulfills the goal of allowing users to place orders through the website.
            <br><br>
            The unique design decisions for this page are going to be in regard to how we present the menu items. As
            shown on the image below, we plan on having a small image for each item, with the name, price, a short
            description and a hypertext to click for a modal with more details about the product to the side of the
            image. On lager devices the option to add and remove items from the order will be on the right-hand side of
            the item details, while on smaller devices this will be below.
        </p>

        <h3>Order confirmation</h3>
        <p>
            This page will contain a simplified list of the selected items, the amount and price. The page will also
            contain buttons for each item to add or remove them from your order as well as a field to add a comment to the
            order.
