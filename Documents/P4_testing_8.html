    <h2> Testing audience and procedure</h2>
    <p>
        We tested the webpage on the intended audience, but not in the condition we think they might be when they would
        be using the webpage. We used live testing with a few sober students, however we expect that a typical user
        would be slightly to moderately intoxicated while using the site. <br>
        To test the website we gave them the url and let them choose whether to use their phone or computer. We then let
        them use the site freely while observing them. After they had used the site we gave them the Google form linked
        below, to get their initial thoughts in writing. The form then gave them some tasks to complete and give
        specific feedback upon. They then gave their final opinion about the site.
        <br><br>
        The google form we used: <a
            href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FMCRrJVypFHiJJjK48&h=AT2pollc0RJZWgXAlYeYJJTXontMZtR76eZtSG_HjtwnyYK-XS-Gxi2Go7_eJTLqyx7gAFzFFW9B6P_9QhvdDNcOV5aAjFaUDSq140VJ0qVAvp5decZWaa3jtfH5tMb0Ot9eSqnDhAPYIBs09ftUrA">

    <h2> Feedback summary </h2>
    <p> The subjects had an easy time navigating the page and finding the contents they were looking for.
        Several subjects commented that the navbar and the layout of each page allowed for
        intuitive navigation, and a website that communicated the structure of the website well.
        It was appreciated that the website had the switch between English and Norwegian
        in order to accommodate for more customers.
