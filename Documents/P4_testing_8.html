    <h2> Testing audience and procedure</h2>
    <p>
        We tested the webpage on the intended audience; students aged 20 to 30, but not in the condition we think they might be when they would
        be using the webpage. We used live testing with a few sober students, however we expect that a typical user
        would be slightly to moderately intoxicated while using the site. <br>
        To test the website we gave them the url and let them choose whether to use their phone or computer. We then let
        them use the site freely while observing them. After they had used the site we gave them the Google form linked
        below, to get their initial thoughts in writing. The form then gave them some tasks to complete and give
        specific feedback upon. They then gave their final opinion about the site. We also observed some students as they
        navigated the page, and asked them to narrate their experience and their thoughts as they were going.
        <br><br>
        The google form we used: <a
            href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FMCRrJVypFHiJJjK48&h=AT2pollc0RJZWgXAlYeYJJTXontMZtR76eZtSG_HjtwnyYK-XS-Gxi2Go7_eJTLqyx7gAFzFFW9B6P_9QhvdDNcOV5aAjFaUDSq140VJ0qVAvp5decZWaa3jtfH5tMb0Ot9eSqnDhAPYIBs09ftUrA">

    <h2> Feedback summary </h2>
    <p> The subjects had an easy time navigating the page and finding the contents they were looking for.
        Several subjects commented that the navbar and the layout of each page allowed for
        intuitive navigation, and a website that communicated the structure of the website well.
        It was appreciated that the website had the switch between English and Norwegian
        in order to accommodate for more customers. One subject commented that navbar-elements and other links
        were easily identifiable because of their change in appearance while hovering over them.
        <br> <br>
        When going to order food from the site, some students chose to go to the menu via the navbar,
        while others opted for clicking the suggested menu-item on the front-page. Once on the menu-page,
        some initial thoughts from the students were that it was well organized, and that the order-total
        being visible at the bottom at all times was very nice. At least one student commented that it was
        nice to have allergens visible on every item. One subject said that if the site had more menu-items,
        it would be nice to have an item-filtering-system at the top, alternatively adding a horizontal line
        between food-categories such as fries, burgers, tacos. One subject also commented that the order of
        the menu-items could be re-arranged so that burgers and tacos were above fries.
        <br><br>
        The checkout-sequence went very smoothly
        for all subjects, however they had some thoughts about how the user experience could be improved.
        One subject wished there was a headline on the order-confirmation-page that told the user where they are.
        This was because the layout of the menu-page and the order-page was similar enough to make some customers
        believe they haven't made it to a new page.
        <br><br>
        One subject also commented that they would appreciate an estimated time for when the order would be ready to pick up.
        They said that this would be a nice feature to include on the order-page and the receipt-page similarly
        to how apps like "Foodora" or "Wolt" do it. This would make it easier for the customer to order while
        they are away from the food-truck, and pick up the food when it's ready.
        <br><br>
        They would also like the receipt to have an order-reference/id so that they knew they could identify their order
        by something other than their name during pick-up. They also said that if the customer had questions about their order,
        it would be nice to have some contact-information and the location of the food-truck at the bottom of the receipt.
        <br><br>
        We asked a couple of the students if they believe they would be able to use the site while intoxicated.
        Their response was that since the layout and navigation is simple, and the text is bold and easily readable,
        it wouldn't be a problem.

    <h2> Our response </h2>
    <p>
        The page got overall good reviews which we are very happy with. There was, however, also some
        constructive criticism and feedback that we analyzed.
        <br><br>
        Some feedback on minor errors and suggestions we got was quite easy to do fixes on, so these were
        corrected or implemented immediately. The most crucial ones were prioritized. This included problems
        such as the page loading as a small screen on Macs even though they were not too small to display the
        full version.
        <br><br>
        Some changes we did not have the time to fix immediately. Specifically, on the About Us page
        we can change the way the headers are connected to each paragraph. This was mentioned once, and we did
        not decide if we want to do anything about it. A possibility is to do it like the downscaled version
        where the headers are above the paragraph.
        <br><br>
        On the Contact Us page there was a desire for some more
        contact information to make contact directly and not through the form. In the menu we could have
        categorized and separated the different categories of food, fries, burgers and tacos. There was also a
        desire to get some information on what the process after the submission of the form would be. This is
        feedback that we would have liked to work further with.
        <br><br>
        Some of the suggestions for additional
        functionality on the ordering process we thought were worth while to consider for future implementation.
        Estimated delivery time, saving orders as a user and more were good suggestions.
        <br><br>
        In general, the page was
        characterized as quite simple. This, we think, is good because some of our target audience are drunk people
        and this would make it easier to use the site. It also looked, according to the feedback, good on phones.
        This was important to us, as the usage of these platforms are potentially the main ones.

    <h2> Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>
        During the project we've learnt a lot from each other and not just HTML, CSS and JS from the course, be it some
        webdesign or how to use git. We think it was a fun challenge having the restrictions of the project upon us. It
        forced those of us who have used more advanced technologies before to take a step back and really think about
        ways around the limitations. While it also let those of us who hadn't to contribute and not get overwhelmed by
        how the more complex technologies work. We also gained a new appreciation for having a backend and database,
        which would have made some stuff a lot easier. While we appreciated the challenge, we don't think we'll stick to
        <i>just</i> HTML, CSS and JS in the future.
