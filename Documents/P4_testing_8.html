    <h2> Testing audience and procedure</h2>
    <p>
        We tested the webpage on the intended audience; students aged 20 to 30, but not in the condition we think they
        might be when they would be using the webpage. We used live testing with a few sober students, however we expect
        that a typical user would be slightly to moderately intoxicated while using the site. <br>
        To test the website we gave them the url and let them choose whether to use their phone or computer. We then let
        them use the site freely while observing them. After they had used the site we gave them the Google form linked
        below, to get their initial thoughts in writing. The form then gave them some tasks to complete and give
        specific feedback upon. They then gave their final opinion about the site. We also observed some students as
        they navigated the page, and asked them to narrate their experience and their thoughts as they were going.
        <br><br>
        The google form we used: <a
            href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FMCRrJVypFHiJJjK48&h=AT2pollc0RJZWgXAlYeYJJTXontMZtR76eZtSG_HjtwnyYK-XS-Gxi2Go7_eJTLqyx7gAFzFFW9B6P_9QhvdDNcOV5aAjFaUDSq140VJ0qVAvp5decZWaa3jtfH5tMb0Ot9eSqnDhAPYIBs09ftUrA">

    <h2> Feedback summary </h2>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong> <br>
        The subjects had an easy time navigating the page and finding the contents they were looking for.
        Several subjects commented that the navbar and the layout of each page allowed for
        intuitive navigation, and a website that communicated the structure of the website well. The subjects gave
        the website an average of <strong>8.3/10</strong> in ease-of-use, and <strong>7/10</strong> in design. It was
        appreciated that the website had the switch between English and Norwegian
        in order to accommodate for more customers. One subject commented that navbar-elements and other links
        were easily identifiable because of their change in appearance while hovering over them. Some subjects
        commented that some buttons were a little small, and some elements took up a little too much room on the page.
        However, it was easy to identify what each button did. In total, the subjects gave the site an average of
        <strong>9.7/10</strong> in navigation.
        <br> <br>
        <strong>Menu</strong><br>
        When going to order food from the site, some students chose to go to the menu via the navbar,
        while others opted for clicking the suggested menu-item on the front-page. Once on the menu-page,
        some initial thoughts from the students were that it was well organized, and that the order-total
        being visible at the bottom at all times was very nice. At least one student commented that it was
        nice to have allergens visible on every item. One subject said that if the site had more menu-items,
        it would be nice to have an item-filtering-system at the top, alternatively adding a horizontal line
        between food-categories such as fries, burgers, tacos. One subject also commented that the order of
        the menu-items could be re-arranged so that burgers and tacos were above fries.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Checkout and receipt</strong> <br>
        The checkout-sequence went very smoothly
        for all subjects, however they had some thoughts about how the user experience could be improved.
        One subject wished there was a headline on the order-confirmation-page that told the user where they are.
        This was because the layout of the menu-page and the order-page was similar enough to make some customers
        believe they haven't made it to a new page.
        <br><br>
        One subject also commented that they would appreciate an estimated time for when the order would be ready to
        pick up. They said that this would be a nice feature to include on the order-page and the receipt-page similarly
        to how apps like "Foodora" or "Wolt" do it. This would make it easier for the customer to order while they are
        away from the food-truck, and pick up the food when it's ready.
        <br><br>
        They would also like the receipt to have an order-reference/id so that they knew they could identify their order
        by something other than their name during pick-up. They also said that if the customer had questions about their
        order, it would be nice to have some contact-information and the location of the food-truck at the bottom of the
        receipt.
        <br><br>
        We asked a couple of the students if they believe they would be able to use the site while intoxicated.
        Their response was that since the layout and navigation is simple, and the text is bold and easily readable,
        it wouldn't be a problem.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Giving Feedback</strong> <br>
        The subjects had an easy time finding where and how to give feedback to the food-truck.
        On average, they gave the intuitiveness and simplicity of the feedback-system a <strong>9.3/10</strong>. The
        only comments were that they would appreciate it if they were told what would happen to their feedback, and that
        some input-boxes had some problems with alignment.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Opening Hours</strong> <br>
        Some subjects said that the opening hours could be displayed more clearly, and that they had to read too much
        text before they found it. One subject suggested that the opening hours were displayed in a footer.
        <br><br>
        <strong>About us</strong> <br>
        At least one subject, who was using a computer, thought the images were breaking the text in an unnatural way.
        It took them a while before they saw the titles for each section of text floating on the left side and realized
        it was meant to be divided that way. They suggested we bring the titles closer to the text so that there is less
        empty space on the page. When they later checked out the mobile version, they said that the page looked good.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Client response</strong> <br>
        We also had an interview and demo of the page with the client. He was very happy about the look of the page
        and the functionality that was there so far. In the future he would like to add more functionality to pages
        that for now does not send information anywhere, like the contact form and the orders. He thinks that an
        integration with a system that could display the orders in the food truck would be great to have. He would also
        like to take professional pictures of his food so that we could have those pictures on the webpage.
        He said that he could supply the official descriptions and allergy lists as well.

    <h2> Our response </h2>
    <p>
        The page got overall good reviews which we are very happy with. There was, however some
        constructive criticism and feedback that we analyzed.
        <br><br>
        Some feedback on minor errors and suggestions were quite manageable, so these were
        corrected or implemented immediately. The most important ones were prioritized. This included problems
        such as the page loading as a small screen on Macs, even though the screens were big enough to display the
        full version.
        <br><br>
        Some suggestions to change would be too time-consuming to fix immediately. Specifically, making the headers
        connected to each paragraph on the about-page. This was by one subject, but we
        decide to not do anything about it. An alternative would be to format the headlines and paragraphs similarly to
        the downscaled version of the page.
        <br><br>
        On the Contact Us page, some subjects would appreciate some more
        contact information to enable direct contact and not only through the form. On the menu-page we could have
        categorized and separated the different categories of food, fries, burgers and tacos. Some subjects wanted
        there to be some indication to the user on what would happen with the feedback they send in through the form.
        These are changes that we would have liked to work further with.
        <br><br>
        Some of the suggestions for additional
        functionality on the ordering process would be considered for future implementation.
        This included estimated delivery time, and saving orders as a user.
        <br><br>
        <strong> General </strong> <br>
        In general, the page was
        characterized as quite simple. This, we think, is good because our target audience is drunk people
        and simplicity would make it easier for them to use the site. According to the feedback, the page looked good
        on mobile devices. This was important to us, as we expect this to be the platform most used by our target audience.
        <br><br>
        <strong> Client's feedback </strong> <br>
        The client's feedback was considered as well. We were happy with his excitement for our page. His wish to
        update the menu items with official information and pictures will be very easy to implement for us.
        Connecting the contact form to an e-mail of his would be some work, but not impossible for us to do. The
        system integration for displaying orders in the food truck would be an entirely different project to this
        one, however. That would require integration of a database and considerable amounts of new code, both
        frontend and backend. It is an exciting idea, but not within the scope of this webpage, currently.

    <h2> Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>
        During the project we learned a lot from each other, not only HTML, CSS and JS from the course, but some
        webdesign and how to collaborate through git. We think the project restrictions made for a fun challenge, as it
        forced those of us who have used more advanced technologies before to take a step back and really think about
        ways around the limitations. Meanwhile, those of us who didn't have as much experience could still contribute to the project
        and not get overwhelmed by the more complex technologies. We also gained a new appreciation for having a back-end and database,
        which would have made some functionalities a lot easier to implement if there were no restrictions. While we
        appreciated the challenge, we don't think we'll stick to
        <i>just</i> HTML, CSS and JS in the future.
