    <h2> Changes </h2>
    <p><span> Change in information handling:</span>
        We changed the information handling from URL to local storage, as we found the solution to be a better choice
        and easier to implement.
    </p>
    <p><span> Change on menu.html:</span>
        We removed the "Added to order" button to save some space and placed the "-" on the left side of the counter
        instead of the right side to make it easier to click on the right button, we also enlarged the buttons.
    </p>
    <p><span> Change on order.html:</span>
        The order summary is more similar to the menu page to reuse more code. The styling for the form is a bit
        different from what was planned, as we wanted to modernize it and make it fit better with the rest of the page.
    </p>
    <p><span> Change on receipt.html:</span>
        The display of the order is made more similar to the two previous pages. The display of the comment is moved up
        and changed to look like the new style of the form. We also changed the title of the page to thank the person
        who placed an order.
    </p>
    <p><span> Change on contact_us.html:</span>
        We changed the form to match the style on the form on order.html.
    </p>
    <p><span> Design for mobile screen:</span>
        We chose to change the design a bit for smaller screens to make it more readable, as the original design got a
        bit cluttered on smaller screens.
    </p>
    <p><span> Overall design changes: </span>
        We chose to change the font size, as the size we had planned for was too big.
    </p>
    <p><span> Functional changes: </span>
        We didn't make the menu filterable, as we ran out of time. We also didn't restrict the possibility to order food
        to whether or not the food truck is open, as it would make it more difficult to test. There is a function in
        main.js that changes the sign on the home page based on if the food truck is open, so it wouldn't be difficult
        to adopt this to disable the order button on the menu page if the food truck is closed.
    </p>

    <p><span>Additional JavaScript file language.js </span>
        We added a separate JavaScript file for language to make the code more readable and organized.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        Jon fulfilled his JavaScript requirements with the functions to make all the menu items for the menu, order and
        receipt page. Kristian implemented modals and adapted it to our page, handled order information transformation
        and response on forms. Silje made the main functions to change language and the base for the function to change
        languages in the html files. We all contributed to expand it to every page and Kristian made dynamic function
        that could more easily translate the static pages. Vetle made a function to check if the food truck is open and
        display the correct sign on homepage.html. We all contributed in every file with smaller functions and design.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    <p>
        To fulfill the modularity requirement we wrote a lot of javascript code. Silje made the navbar in main.js and
        added it to every html file. Jon made a solution to dynamically create the menu based on the menu items defined
        in the javascript file, so that changing the menu would be easy as well as getting the selected items on a
        different page, like order and receipt page. Kristian adapted the modal example code from
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> into main.js, so that the modals would work
        on the order, about us and contact us page without duplicate code. We also create language.js, which changes the
        language of every page by changing the text in each element on every page instead of having a Norwegian version
        and an English version of the page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Responsive webdesign</h2>
    <p>
        To make the website work equally on any device we relied on css. We implemented a @media query to change some
        styles for smaller devices. We landed a max-width of 1023 through trial and error. Setting it higher would make
        some iPads show the mobile version while the screen being large enough to comfortably displaying the desktop
        version. Going lower made the desktop version show on high resolution mobile screens. We also experimented with
        -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio, but that caused MacBooks to display the mobile version.<br>
        While making the site we scaled down the window to see how it looked on smaller screens and add custom css
        within the @media query to make it work better on smaller devices. We all contributed to the css of the smaller
        screens, but the main design changes going from desktop to mobile version were done by Silje and Vetle.
